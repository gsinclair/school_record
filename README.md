school\_record: record daily activity for a number of classes
=============================================================

**school\_record** is an infant project to meet some of my needs as a high school
teacher:
 * Record what I did with each class each day, including homework assigned
   and perhaps other useful specific (and reportable data).
 * Produce easily read reports of what I've typed in.
   * What happened today/this week/etc.?
   * When did I start and finish each topic?
   * What homework have I assigned?
 * Understand the school calendar:
   * Know what days I see each class and prompt me that some entries are yet
     to be recorded.
   * Know what days school is in session.
   * Understand the school calendar: semesters, terms, weeks, reporting periods.
 * Know about (via configuration) known obstacles to lessons, like exam blocks,
   staff days, excursions, etc.
   * Produce reports on lessons remaining for a given Year group this term, for
     instance, that takes known obstacles into account.
 * (Maybe) Record simple tasks like writing exams so that reminders are given
   whenever I run the program, I get a gentle reminder.
   * In fact, it could be aware of exam-writing timetables, and give reminders
     about specific milestones (Draft 1, Draft 2, etc.).
 * (Maybe) Provide basic calendar features for parent-teacher nights, exam
   blocks, etc.
 * (Probably) Record notes about specific students, e.g. good work, missing
   equipment, etc.  These would be tied to a date, not a specific lesson.
   * Produce a list of all such notes grouped by student for a given class,
     making it easier to write reports.
 * Store data in plain text on Dropbox allowing easy and fast (i.e. incremental)
   synchronisation between computers.
